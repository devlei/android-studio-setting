      <item value="Block the producer from generating new images. Once the producer has produced the number of images equal to the image queue depth, and none have been closed, the producer will stop producing images. Note that images may be queued internally and not be delivered to the analyzer until the last delivered image has been closed with ImageProxy.close(). These internally queued images will count towards the total number of images that the producer can provide at any one time. When the producer stops producing images, it may also stop producing images for other use cases, such as Preview, so it is important for the analyzer to keep up with frame rate, on average. Failure to keep up with frame rate may lead to jank in the frame stream and a diminished user experience. If more time is needed for analysis on some frames, consider increasing the image queue depth with ImageAnalysis.Builder.setImageQueueDepth(int).
